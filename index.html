            <h3 style="font-size: 1.6rem; margin-bottom: 25px; color: #fff; font-weight: 400;">Fonofone — Democratizing Musical Creation Through Play</h3>
            
            <p>Fonofone is an innovative sound-creation tool designed to democratize music-making for children, even those with little or no formal musical training. Built around exploration, gesture, and play, Fonofone allows young users to compose, perform, and improvise intuitively—learning by doing, and above all, having fun while creating real music. Its philosophy is simple: lower the technical barriers so creativity can emerge naturally.</p>
            
            <p>On February 21, 2017, Fonofone was officially launched on the Apple App Store. To mark the occasion, a group of young fonofonists from Hélène-Boullé Elementary School presented a live performance using Fonofone during the launch celebrations at the PHI Centre in Montréal.</p>
            
            <p>Their performance demonstrated exactly what Fonofone was designed to achieve: children confidently shaping sound, structuring musical ideas, and performing collectively—without the constraints of traditional notation or years of technical training. Fonofone transforms musical creation into an inclusive, joyful, and empowering experience, where curiosity leads and creativity follows.</p>
            
            <p>Through Fonofone, musical expression becomes accessible, immediate, and deeply human—turning play into composition, and listeners into creators.</p>

            <h2>Biography</h2>
            
            <h3 style="font-size: 1.8rem; margin-bottom: 30px; color: #fff; font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.3;">Yves Daoust — Internationally Renowned Composer and Pioneer of Electroacoustic Music</h3>
            
            <p>Born in Longueuil, Québec, Yves Daoust is one of the most distinctive and influential voices in contemporary electroacoustic music. His work—performed and renewed internationally across Canada, Europe, and beyond—stands at the crossroads of concert music, cinema, pedagogy, and sound research. Few composers have so consistently transformed listening itself into an artistic experience, positioning Daoust as a central figure in electroacoustic and mixed music on the world stage.</p>
            
            <p>A decisive encounter with Maurice Blackburn led Daoust to the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), where he undertook specialized training in film music techniques. Immersed in the legendary Sound Workshop, he developed a refined sensitivity to sound-image relationships, narrative listening, and spatial perception. During this period, he notably collaborated with media theorist Marshall McLuhan, an encounter that profoundly shaped his thinking on media, perception, and the cognitive dimensions of sound—ideas that would resonate throughout his later compositions.</p>
            
            <p>Daoust pursued advanced training at the Institut international de musique électroacoustique de Bourges (IMEB), one of the world's most important centers for electroacoustic creation. At Bourges, he was deeply influenced by the artistic processes of Alain Savouret, particularly the concept of "virtual cinema," which treats sound as a dramaturgical space in itself. This approach became foundational to Daoust's aesthetic: music not merely as structure, but as a lived, cinematic experience for the ear.</p>
            
            <p>In 1978, Daoust co-founded ACREQ (Association pour la création et la recherche électroacoustiques du Québec)—an organization that would later evolve into Elektra. Through concerts, site-specific events, radio broadcasts, and international forums, ACREQ played a decisive role in the global diffusion of electroacoustic music and in the development of sound projection practices worldwide. Daoust's leadership helped establish Québec as a major hub of electroacoustic innovation.</p>
            
            <p>In 1981, he was appointed professor at the Conservatoire de musique et d'art dramatique du Québec, where he was mandated to design and implement comprehensive electroacoustic programs for both the Montréal and Québec City branches. His pedagogical vision shaped generations of composers and institutionalized electroacoustic composition as a rigorous artistic discipline.</p>

            <h3 style="font-size: 1.4rem; margin: 40px 0 20px; color: #fff; font-weight: 400;">Key Works and Artistic Trajectory</h3>
            <p>Since his professional debut in 1978, Daoust has composed at a remarkably steady pace—nearly one major work per year—across electroacoustic, mixed, instrumental, and interdisciplinary genres. Among his most significant and emblematic compositions:</p>
            
            <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Paris, les Grands-Magasins (1976)</strong><br>
            A landmark work rooted in nature, using phonography and everyday urban sounds to capture lived experience with cinematic intensity.</p>
            
            <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Quatuor (1979)</strong><br>
            A foundational musique concrète piece grounded in culture, revisiting musical heritage through radical sound transformation.</p>
            
            <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Valse (1981)</strong><br>
            A seminal mixed work for ensemble and tape, inaugurating Daoust's distinctive approach in which instrumental and electroacoustic layers coexist in parallel discourses rather than merging.</p>
            
            <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Suite baroque (1995)</strong><br>
            A striking example of Daoust's dialogue with historical forms, filtered through electroacoustic thinking.</p>
            
            <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Petite musique sentimentale (2000)</strong><br>
            A refined exploration of memory, intimacy, and listening, widely performed and frequently cited among his most accessible works.</p>
            
            <p><strong style="color: #fff;">Chorals ornés (2007–2008)</strong><br>
            A mature synthesis of his aesthetic, where nature and culture unfold simultaneously without fusion, affirming his unique compositional voice.</p>
            
            <p>A long-standing collaboration with Mimes Omnibus and its artistic director Jean Asselin further extended Daoust's work into interdisciplinary performance, reinforcing the theatrical and gestural dimensions of his music.</p>

            <h3 style="font-size: 1.4rem; margin: 40px 0 20px; color: #fff; font-weight: 400;">Influences & Aesthetic Lineage</h3>
            <p>Daoust openly embraces a broad constellation of influences, ranging from film music to John Cage, Iannis Xenakis, Mauricio Kagel, Luc Ferrari, Alain Savouret, Karlheinz Stockhausen (notably Hymnen), Ludwig van Beethoven, Robert Schumann, and the visual imagination of René Magritte. These references are never imitative; they are reactivated through Daoust's singular sensitivity to sound as perception, memory, and space.</p>

            <h3 style="font-size: 1.4rem; margin: 40px 0 20px; color: #fff; font-weight: 400;">Transmission & Innovation</h3>
            <p>Committed to artistic transmission, Daoust also designed Fonofone (also known as Musicolateur)—a sound-creation instrument intended to awaken musical creativity in young people. Since 2004, this project has remained a vital part of his artistic and pedagogical engagement, echoing his long-standing belief that listening is a learned, creative act.</p>

            <h3 style="font-size: 1.4rem; margin: 40px 0 20px; color: #fff; font-weight: 400;">Recognition</h3>
            <p>In recognition of his lifelong contribution to musical creation, innovation, and transmission, Yves Daoust received the Prix Serge-Garant from the Fondation Émile-Nelligan in 2009.</p>
